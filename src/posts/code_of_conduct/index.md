HackWITus values inclusion and accessibility for all of our community members. We strive to foster a strong and compassionate community that values individual respect above all else. Nobody in our community should ever have to feel harassed or uncomfortable whether online or at an event. It is everyone’s responsibility to create this healthy environment.
